        <p class="bg-blue-50 mt-2 rounded">The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents.
            It represents the structure of an HTML or XML document as a tree-like model. The purpose of the DOM is to
            provide a way for programs and scripts to access and manipulate the content and structure of a web document.

            Name the DOM methods.</h1>
        <p class="bg-gray-300 mt-2 rounded">Some common DOM elements for selecting HTML elements are: <br>
            getElementsByTagName() <br> getElementsByClassName() <br> getElementById() <br> querySelector() <br>
            querySelectorAll()

        <p class="bg-pink-200 mt-2 rounded">Event Bubbling is a concept in the DOM (Document Object Model). It happens
            when an element receives an event, and that event bubbles up. For example, if you click on a child element
            within a parent element, the click event will first be triggered on the child element, and then it will
            propagate up through the parent element, the grandparent element, and so on, until it reaches the root
            elements .</p>

        <h1 class="text-xl text-black bg-lime-200 rounded font-bold">04: What is a callback function and why will you
            use it?</h1>
        <p class="bg-lime-200 mt-2 rounded">A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another
            function and then executed inside the parent function. A common use case for a callback function is in
            asynchronous programming, where a function must wait for some operation to complete before continuing.
            Callbacks can also be used in event-driven programming, where a function is triggered in response to some
            user action, such as clicking a button or scrolling a page.</p>
